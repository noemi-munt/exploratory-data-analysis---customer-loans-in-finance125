## Project Description
This project conducts **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a financial loans dataset. The primary goal is to gain insights into the portfolio of a loan company by cleaning, transforming, and analysing the data.

### Objectives:
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Handle missing values and data inconsistencies 
- Convert data types appropriately (e.g., categorical encoding, datetime conversion)
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis
- Visualise key trends and relationships

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of **data preprocessing**, **data handling**, and **basic financial data analysis**.

## Installation Instructions

   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load the loan dataset
